# erasmus-sds
This project consisted in building a Web Application that would allow Erasmus students to fill the Learning Agreement easily. 
They'll be able to insert information on their own or choose from pre-programed one (which is the case of the faculties and courses from Politechnika Poznanska).
We used an MVC pattern with C# (.net core 2.2), HTML, CSS, and SQLite as our database (where we store all the information regarding the courses, faculties and learning agreements).
All this information can be found within the project.

## Project Strategy 
Our strategy to this project consists in an iterative approach, which means that for each Sprint we would define the Sprint goals and the strategies to achieve those goals. 

## Communication Stratagies
Our Scrum Team will be using different strategies of comunication:
  - Whatsapp as a frequent way of comunication among the Team Members to share and discuss ideas and expose doubts and difficulties concerning the evolution of the project.
  - Meetings (in here it's included the Sprint Planing, a weekly meeting to check on the progress and discuss what should be done next, the Srint Retrospective and the Sprint Review) as a way to discuss what should be done, what can be improved, what was previously done, to check the improvement of the solution as a whole and also to check on the different items that lead to the final solution
  - GitHub as a way to ensure that every member has access to the different stages of the project
