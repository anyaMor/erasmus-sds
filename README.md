## Communication Stratagies
Our Scrum Team will be using different strategies of comunication:
  - Whatsapp as a frequent way of comunication among the Team Members to share and discuss ideas and expose doubts and difficulties concerning the evolution of the project.
  - Meetings (in here it's included the Sprint Planing, a weekly meeting to check on the progress and discuss what should be done next, the Srint Retrospective and the Sprint Review) as a way to discuss what should be done, what can be improved, what was previously done, to check the improvement of the solution as a whole and also to check on the different items that lead to the final solution
